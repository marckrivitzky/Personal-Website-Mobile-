					     	Hi! Thanks for visiting my website! My name is Marc Krivitzky and I'm a 
							creative, organized, and hard working individual looking to begin my career 
							in front-end development. Before beginning my journey into developing, I worked
							 as an accounting administrator at a company called AKRF, Inc. This experience 
							provided a strong foundation in interpersonal, analytical, and collaborative 
							problem solving, as well as more general administrative tasks within 
							a professional setting. During my time working at AKRF, I dreamed of finding 
							a career path that excited me and made me want to jump out of bed everyday. 
							In 2020, during the height of the COVID pandemic, I began to think about my 
							long term career goals more and decided to leave AKRF. I was passionate about art 
							and using my creative talents to build and develop something new and unique, which 
							lead me to coding and web development. In the beginning of 2021, I started my journey
							 to learn how to code by enrolling in an intensive coding bootcamp called Promineo Tech. 
							I instantly fell in love with everything about coding and have been working actively to 
							expand my skillset and grow my career in this space ever since. At Promineo Tech, I  primarily 
							focused on building and developing my frontend skills such as: Javascript, HTML, CSS, Jquery, AJAX, 
							and ReactJS. I look forward to continuing to grow my skills and work for a company that values creative 
							and entrepreneurial thinkers like myself.  Please feel free to explore everything my website has to offer!
